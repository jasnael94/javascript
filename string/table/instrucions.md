In JavaScript, it's very common to return a string that represents some HTML code. In fact, we’ll be doing this quite often in the DOM chapters. String interpolation is particularly useful here, as it allows for multi-line strings and variable insertion.

Your task: complete the `renderTableRow` function so that it returns the following HTML:

```html
<tr>
  <td>label here</td>
  <td>value here</td>
</tr>
```

Here, `label here` and `value here` should be replaced with the values of the `label` and `value` parameters, respectively.

Make sure to check the code in `index.js` to see how this function is being used. (The DOM code might not make complete sense just yet — that’s normal, we haven’t covered everything.)
