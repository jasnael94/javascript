# Get next age I

 Complete the function getNextAge such that it returns the age next year (by adding 1 to the current age).
Note that the age is provided by the user in a text box (which you can try in the browser tab).
Do not worry about getting NaN when the text box is empty for now, we'll deal with that in a future chapter.
